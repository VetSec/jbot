This is a HipChat version of the 'jbot' IRC bot,
originally "developed" at Yahoo! in 2007.  This
variant was created as a rewrite in Go for HipChat
in July 2016 by Jan Schaumann (@jschauma /
jschauma@netmeister.org).  Many thanks to Yahoo for
letting me play around with nonsense like this.

You should be able to run the bot by populating a
configuration file with suitable values.  The
following configuration values are required:
   password = the HipChat password of the bot user
   jabberID = the HipChat / JabberID of the bot user
   fullName = how the bot presents itself
   mentionName = to which name the bot responds to

This bot has a bunch of features that are company
internal; those features have been removed from
this public version.

Some day this should be extended into a pluggable
bot, so that internal code can more easily be kept
apart, I suppose.  Pull requests welcome etc.


Some of the URLs used by the bot reference simple text
documents hosted on an internal server.  This is so as
to not rely on outside resources and their flimsy
markups as well as to control the contents somewhat.
You can grep the sources for 'XXX' and replace the
URLs with a link to a location you control.  (This,
too, could be improved to be configurable.)

Interacting with the bot:

Getting jbot to join your channel:

/invite jbot

Getting jbot to leave your channel:

!leave


jbot responds to:
- commands invoked via '!command' -- see '!help'
- commands invoked via @-mentioning the bot:
  !command     => "@jbot command"
  !command arg => "@jbot command arg"

If 'chatter' is not toggled off (it is on by default),
jbot will also:
- reply to any statement that is addressed to it:
  How are you today, jbot?
  jbot, you suck

- chime in with certain semi-random replies (sure, you
  got the source, but the fun part is figuring out
  what triggers what type of response); some of these
  responses are throttled to avoid too repetitive
  annoyances
